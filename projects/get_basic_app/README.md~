Required Python Package: 
lpthw.web or web.py

sudo -H pip install lpthw.web

## Make a Simple "Hello World" Project
Now you're going to make an initial very simple "Hello World" web
application and project directory using lpthw.web. First, make your project directory:

$ cd projects
$ mkdir gothonweb
$ cd gothonweb
$ mkdir bin gothonweb tests docs templates
$ touch gothonweb/__init__.py
$ touch tests/__init__.py

You'll be taking the game from Exercise 43 and making it into a web application,
so that's why you're calling it gothonweb
Before you do that, we need to create the most basic lpthw.web application
possible. You need to write bin/app.py for actual web app to work

Then run the application like this:

$ python bin/app.py
http://0.0.0.0:8080/
However, if you did this:

$ cd bin/   # WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!
$ python app.py  # WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!

Then you are doing it wrong. In all Python projects you do not cd into a
lower directory to run things. You stay at the top and run everything from
there so that all of the system can access all the modules and files.
# Finally, use your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ and 
you should see two things. First, in your browser you'll see 
Hello, world!. Second, you'll see your Terminal with new output like this:

$ python bin/app.py
http://0.0.0.0:8080/
127.0.0.1:59542 - - [13/Jun/2011 11:44:43] "HTTP/1.1 GET /" - 200 OK
127.0.0.1:59542 - - [13/Jun/2011 11:44:43] "HTTP/1.1 GET /favicon.ico" - 404 Not Found

Those are log messages that lpthw.web prints out so you can see that the
server is working, and what the browser is doing behind the scenes. The log
messages help you debug and figure out when you have problems. For example,
it's saying that your browser tried to get /favicon.ico but that file didn't 
exist so it returned 404 Not Found status code.
